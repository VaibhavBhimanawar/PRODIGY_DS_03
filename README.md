# PRODIGY_DS_03
Customer Purchase Prediction using Decision Tree Classifier
This project builds a Decision Tree Classifier to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on demographic and behavioral data. The analysis uses the Bank Marketing Dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

Objective
to preprocess and analyze customer data.
Building and visualizing a Decision Tree model.
Evaluating the performance of your classifier.

ðŸ›  Tools Used:

Python
Scikit-learn
Pandas
Matplotlib/Seaborn

Steps in the Project
Data Preprocessing:
Handle missing values and encode categorical variables.
Normalize numerical features where necessary.
Model Building:
Train a Decision Tree Classifier using scikit-learn.
Perform hyperparameter tuning for optimal performance.
Model Evaluation:
Use metrics such as confusion matrix, ROC curve, and classification report.
Visualization:
Visualize the decision tree and feature importance.
